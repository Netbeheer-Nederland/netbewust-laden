= Netbewust Laden

The joint network operators expect that due to the rapidly increasing demand
for grid capacity on the low-voltage (LV) networks, congestion issues will
arise, and _Netbewust Laden_ is seen as one of the solutions.

This data product provides network operators with the opportunity to
periodically provide municipalities, charging station operators, _NAL_ regions,
and other stakeholders with uniform insights into which areas are expected to
experience (impending) capacity shortages.

This is to facilitate the mobility transition and to optimally utilize the
locally available grid capacity for all electricity users, preventing overload
caused by peaks in demand. The alternative is to reinforce the grid, which has
a long lead time, requires high investments, and will delay the energy
transition.
